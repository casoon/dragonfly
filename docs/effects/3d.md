# 3D Effects
> Last Modified: 18.05.2024

## File Purpose

This file provides a comprehensive collection of 3D transformation effects for modern UIs. It includes various rotation, flip, scale, and perspective effects to create depth and dimensional interest. All effects are performance-optimized and respect user preferences for reduced motion.

## CSS Utility Classes

### Base 3D Classes

#### `.transform-3d`
- Description: Base class for 3D transformations
- Uses: perspective and preserve-3d settings
- Enables: Child elements to be positioned in 3D space

### Rotation Classes

#### `.rotate-3d`
- Description: Rotates element in all three dimensions
- Uses: rotate3d transform with transition
- Includes: Enhanced rotation on hover

#### `.rotate-3d-x`
- Description: Rotates element around the X-axis
- Uses: rotateX transform with transition
- Includes: Enhanced rotation on hover

#### `.rotate-3d-y`
- Description: Rotates element around the Y-axis
- Uses: rotateY transform with transition
- Includes: Enhanced rotation on hover

#### `.rotate-3d-z`
- Description: Rotates element around the Z-axis
- Uses: rotateZ transform with transition
- Includes: Enhanced rotation on hover

### Flip Effect Classes

#### `.flip-3d`
- Description: Creates a card flip effect in 3D space
- Uses: preserve-3d and transition properties
- Includes: Full 180-degree Y-axis rotation on hover

#### `.flip-3d-front` / `.flip-3d-back`
- Description: Container for front and back faces of flippable element
- Uses: backface-visibility to hide reverse side
- Includes: Absolute positioning to stack faces

### Additional Transform Classes

#### `.scale-3d`
- Description: Scales element in all three dimensions
- Uses: scale3d transform with transition
- Includes: Enlargement on hover

#### `.translate-3d`
- Description: Moves element in 3D space
- Uses: translate3d transform with transition
- Includes: Movement in all dimensions on hover

#### `.skew-3d`
- Description: Applies skew transform for distortion effect
- Uses: skew transform with transition
- Includes: Enhanced skew angle on hover

### Perspective Classes

#### `.perspective-3d`
- Description: Applies standard perspective to container
- Uses: 1000px depth perspective
- Enables: 3D effects for child elements

#### `.perspective-3d-sm`
- Description: Applies shallow perspective to container
- Uses: 500px depth perspective
- Creates: More subtle 3D effects

#### `.perspective-3d-lg`
- Description: Applies deep perspective to container
- Uses: 2000px depth perspective
- Creates: More dramatic 3D effects

### Transform Origin Classes

#### `.origin-3d`
- Description: Sets transform origin to center
- Uses: center center transform-origin
- Controls: Pivot point for transformations

#### `.origin-3d-top`
- Description: Sets transform origin to top center
- Uses: center top transform-origin
- Creates: Transformations that pivot from top

#### `.origin-3d-bottom`
- Description: Sets transform origin to bottom center
- Uses: center bottom transform-origin
- Creates: Transformations that pivot from bottom

#### `.origin-3d-left`
- Description: Sets transform origin to left center
- Uses: left center transform-origin
- Creates: Transformations that pivot from left

#### `.origin-3d-right`
- Description: Sets transform origin to right center
- Uses: right center transform-origin
- Creates: Transformations that pivot from right

#### Corner Origin Classes
- `.origin-3d-top-left` - Top left pivot point
- `.origin-3d-top-right` - Top right pivot point
- `.origin-3d-bottom-left` - Bottom left pivot point
- `.origin-3d-bottom-right` - Bottom right pivot point

## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

The 3D effects primarily use standard CSS transform properties without custom variables, which ensures broad browser compatibility.

Key transform properties used:
- `transform: rotate3d()` - 3D rotation around multiple axes
- `transform: rotateX/Y/Z()` - Single-axis rotations
- `transform: scale3d()` - 3D scaling
- `transform: translate3d()` - 3D movement
- `transform: skew()` - 2D skewing
- `perspective` - 3D depth perception
- `transform-origin` - Pivot point for transformations
- `backface-visibility` - Visibility of element reverse side

## Responsive / Media Behavior

### `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
- Disables all transitions on interactive 3D elements
- Cancels transform effects on hover states
- Ensures accessibility for users who are sensitive to motion
- Affects all rotation, flip, scale, translate, and skew classes
