# High-Level Goals and Requirements for @casoon/ui-lib

This document outlines pragmatic, high-level goals derived from key design concepts such as Design Systems, Principles, and Patterns. These goals serve as guiding requirements for the development of the @casoon/ui-lib project.

## 1. Design Systems – A Consistent, Scalable Foundation

**Goal:** Establish a modular, consistent design system that can be reused across projects.

**Requirements:**

- Systematic naming and structural organization for all tokens and components.
- A token-based design foundation leveraging CSS custom properties.
- Theming support and extensibility through layer-based design architecture (e.g., tokens, utilities, components).

## 2. Design Principles – Reflect Clear Visual and Functional Rules

**Goal:** Ensure all UI components follow shared principles to maintain coherence in appearance and behavior.

**Requirements:**

- Unified rules for layout, spacing, typography, and sizing.
- Components should be understandable and usable even without relying on external design tools.
- Clear separation of presentation and logic in both structure and styling.

## 3. Functional Patterns – Reusable, Adaptive Component Blueprints

**Goal:** Provide abstracted patterns for common interactions and functional behaviors.

**Requirements:**

- Modular component patterns like Dialog, Accordion, Dropdown, designed with minimal JavaScript.
- Components should be easily configurable and adaptable to various use cases.
- Accessibility (a11y) must be considered a first-class concern.

## 4. Perceptual Patterns – Intuitive Feedback and Visual Communication

**Goal:** Implement perceptual cues that improve user understanding and feedback.

**Requirements:**

- Definition and support for component states like hover, focus, disabled, error, loading, success.
- Utility classes or animations to support interactive transitions and effects.
- All components should respond properly across screen sizes and devices (responsive design).

## 5. Shared Language – Unified Naming and API Convention

**Goal:** Promote a common language between design and development.

**Requirements:**

- Token names, components, and utilities should follow a consistent and documented naming convention.
- Clear CSS class API (e.g., btn-primary, gap-md, card-lg) that is intuitive and predictable.
- Terminology and structure should reflect a systemized mental model shared across the project.
