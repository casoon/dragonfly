# Comparison: @casoon/ui-lib vs. Bootstrap vs. Tailwind CSS

This document outlines the key differences in approach between @casoon/ui-lib and the popular CSS frameworks Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.

## @casoon/ui-lib vs. Bootstrap

### Architecture
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Uses a modern CSS layer architecture with `@layer` for clear specificity control. Heavy emphasis on CSS Custom Properties and native CSS features.
- **Bootstrap**: Based on a more traditional class API with less granular control over specificity. Uses SASS/SCSS extensively for variables and components.

### Component Approach
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Framework-agnostic CSS components with minimal JavaScript. Components are implemented as CSS classes without requiring JavaScript counterparts.
- **Bootstrap**: More tightly coupled components where many advanced features require JavaScript (jQuery in older versions, standalone JS in newer ones).

### Customizability
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Token-based design system with comprehensive theming capabilities via CSS variables. Modular structure for selective usage.
- **Bootstrap**: Less granular customization options, often requiring SASS compilation for deep changes.

### Modern CSS Features
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Leverages the latest CSS features like Container Queries, Logical Properties, `@layer`, and CSS functions like OKLCH colors.
- **Bootstrap**: Relies more on proven, widely supported CSS techniques where compatibility is prioritized over cutting-edge features.

## @casoon/ui-lib vs. Tailwind CSS

### Philosophy
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Balances component-based and utility-based approaches in a harmonious system. Provides pre-built components and utilities.
- **Tailwind**: Pure utility-first approach that relies almost exclusively on atomic utility classes. No pre-built components in the core library.

### CSS Organization
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Clearly defined layer structure with semantic class names for components and complementary utilities.
- **Tailwind**: Flat class structure with a multitude of short, atomic utility classes applied directly in HTML.

### Build Process
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Optimized for Lightning CSS but works without a special build process. Can be used as normal CSS imports.
- **Tailwind**: Requires a build process with PostCSS and JIT compilation to optimize file size.

### Learning Curve and Usage
- **@casoon/ui-lib**: Easier learning curve through semantic components while maintaining flexibility with utilities. Balance between class names and their quantity in HTML.
- **Tailwind**: Steeper learning curve for the many utility classes, leads to "utility soup" in HTML with many classes per element.

## Unique Strengths of @casoon/ui-lib

1. **Container Query System**: Advanced approach for component-based responsiveness, less dependent on global breakpoints.

2. **Accessibility**: Built from the ground up with a focus on accessibility features like keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and reduced motions.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implements careful fallback strategies for older browsers while fully utilizing modern features.

4. **Framework Independence**: Optimized for Astro but completely framework-agnostic with no JavaScript dependencies.

5. **Theming System**: Comprehensive dark/light mode system with extended theme variants through CSS Custom Properties.

## When to Choose @casoon/ui-lib

@casoon/ui-lib is particularly well-suited for:

- Projects that need to balance pre-built components with customization flexibility
- Developers who prefer working with modern CSS features natively
- Websites and applications where accessibility is a priority
- Projects using Astro or other modern build tools that benefit from CSS optimization
- Teams that want a more balanced approach between utility classes and semantic components

In comparison, @casoon/ui-lib offers a more modern, CSS-focused approach with a more balanced mix of components and utilities than the two established alternatives.
